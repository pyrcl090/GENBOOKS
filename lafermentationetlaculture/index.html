As an important cultural artifact fermented foods have played a vital role in the development of minds and bodies since before the common era. However, capitalism and its byproducts have crerated a culture of commodification that today extends to ferrmented foods and perpetuates their fetishization in western culture.</p>

        <p class="texte">Som visited our class last week to present his work to us. I really enjoyed listening to his lecture. I think the use of his heritage and collaboration with other artists in his work is so beautiful. My favorite work he presented was the textile collaboration. Som kicked off his presentation by explaining the idea of fermentation and how objects and flavors change during this process. If I'm not mistaken, he mentioned dahi which is Indian curd. This is made through the process of fermentation, much like yogurt. I think that the idea of taking something that exists and letting it transform overtime is such a cool way of thinking.<br><br>I really enjoyed listening to Som speak about his work and his collaboration with other artists. I think it was also really nice to see these collaborations occur over something like Google Hangouts during a pandemic. What was nice to hear was, Som usually works this way anyway. Which is just so fulfilling. I felt like it was a reminder that we can create things even when we are not in our normal environment.</p>

            <br><br>
            The term kefir is kinda new to me, as an iranian we call yogurt "maast" (read it like "must", ماست) and there is a fermented beverage from it called "doug"/ دوغ.
            <br><br>
            In that part of the world which i assume is the origin of yogurt.
            But we have lost so much of the culture to wars but there is still some left.
            <br><br>
            There is another thing we have which plays a big role in iranian cuisine, pickling, specially garlic pickling in apple vinengar.
            people love it to their life ... it should be fermented for at least 6month some people keep it as long as they want (years).

        Gross-lait, or gross milk, is the summer food of the Bretons. They add ferment to fresh milk and stir it; at a temperature of seventy- seven degrees Fahrenheit, the curdling is done after twelve hours; they then separate the cream that has accumulated on top and set it apart for consumption. It is a gelatinous milk with a slightly sour taste and the scent of fermented cream. Like kefir, leben has the disadvantage of being prepared with impure ferments.

            Yamahai:
            <br><br>
            In the early 1900’s, one brewer discovered that all of this hard work was not necessary: if the brewers just monitored and controlled the temperature, water levels, exposure to air and a few other variables, the lactic bacteria in the yeast starter would naturally produce lactic acid which would fight off unwanted bacteria and yeasts. Yamahai sake still takes roughly four weeks to make and a high degree of control and skill, but it does not require the same manual labor as kimoto. Yamahai sakes are deep, layered and complex but tend to be earthier and smokier than kimotos.
            <br><br>
            Kimoto:
            <br><br>
            Ki means “original” and moto is the yeast starter; thus, kimoto means “original yeast starter.” Naturally, it was the original way that sake makers completed this essential step. Started in the 1700’s, the kimoto method requires sake brewers to mush up the yeast starter with bamboo poles for hours on end, day in and day out for roughly four weeks. Mushing the yeast starter tightens the mixture and removes oxygen. As a result, lactic bacteria cannot easily survive and lactic acid is naturally created. Kimoto sake tends to be wild, funky, gamey, layered and rich. Kimotos can also have greater length of flavor.
            <br><br>
            Gen-shu:
            <br><br>
            Sake which has not been diluted with water after fermentation. Thus, gen-shu usually has an alcohol content of 20%, whereas most sake is brought down to about 15% to 16%. Gen-shu is generally released and marketed as a special product, but a very small number of brewers make most of their sake as gen-shu without saying it is.
            <br><br>
            Nama-zake:
            <br><br>
            Sake which has not been pasteurized. Almost all sake is pasteurized twice to maintain stability. Nama-zake or “live sake” has not been pasteurized and, thus, has a raw, brash personality to it.
            <br>Nama-zake is usually released in the spring instead of going through the six-month storage period which lasts until the fall. Nama-zake should always be kept refrigerated and immediately after being released.
            <br><br>
            Nigori-sake:
            <br><br>
            Literally meaning “cloudy sake,” is sake with the lees still in the bottle. Sake makers achieve this by running the sake through a coarser filter or by adding the lees back in after filtration. Nigori sake has a creamy mouthfeel and a smooth, easy-going flavor. It should be refrigerated.

        <p class="texte">You can be sure that when you buy our ferments, what you are eating or drinking is part of an important food movement; a return to traditions - to living foods and small batch real food and drinks. We are wild fermenters in a largely homogenised world. We don't water down, force carbonate or add starter cultures. Our choices have never been convenient and by supporting us you are encouraging and supporting an artisan business that puts our customers, our earth, flavours, and the drive toward a better food system first.
            <br><br>
            "Resistance takes place on many planes. Sometimes it must be dramatic and public, but most of the decisions we are faced with are mundane and private. What to eat is a choice that we make several times a day, if we are lucky. The cumulative choices we make about food have profound implications.
            <br><br>
            Food offers us many opportunities to resist the culture of mass marketing and commodification.…We do not have to be reduced to the role of consumers selecting from seductive convenience items. We can merge appetite with activism and choose to involve ourselves in food as co-creators". Sandor Katz</p>

Kombucha, the ancient art of brewing fermented tea, is a process of using imperceptible bacteria that is specific to its brewing facility. All kombucha is different and is celebrated because it picks up bacteria from the environment where it is brewed, independent of human manipulation - resulting in healthful 'good' bacteria. Such experiments are taking place for many reasons other than the tantalising of human senses: alternative sources of protein, ecology, ethics and probiotics.

When a pét-nat is first released, he says it may still be a tad sweet—the result of some residual sugar that hasn’t yet undergone fermentation. “It tends to get drier [as time passes], and to speed that up you can put a bottle in a sunny window for a few days.” (The sunlight helps encourage the in-bottle fermentation.) He also says that a pét-nat’s bubbles often become softer and smaller as it ages. But pét-nats aren’t meant for long cellaring. “I generally suggest that people drink them within three months of buying,” he says.</p>

However, the effects of long‐term exposure of the colonic mucosa to those metabolites remain unclear. Available evidence at present seems insufficient to support a role of protein fermentation in the risk of bowel diseases. It is possible that the impact of protein fermentation is overshadowed by other dietary or lifestyle factors.
